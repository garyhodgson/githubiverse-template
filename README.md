githubiverse-template
============

**Note: There is a major limitation to this template due to Github's API rate limit, see [issue #5](https://github.com/garyhodgson/githubiverse-template/issues/5) for details.**

**Also, I consider the [thing-tracker-site-template](https://github.com/garyhodgson/thing-tracker-site-template) to be a successor to this project. Have a look at [this blog post](http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2014/06/thing-tracker-site-template/) for more details.**


This is a Github Page template to show off your 3D printer model or project.  Inspiration clearly taken from the excellent Thingiverse.
